# Weather-App
Made a weather-app using HTML5, CSS3, and javascript. Used opeweathermap api to get the live weather updates from all around the world.

# Leaving the api-key as a "blank" in weather.js for security reasons.

Little cool feature: The background image changes depending on the temperature.
